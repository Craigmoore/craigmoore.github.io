      <h2>Rules of building on github pages :</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Create an entirely public repository on github.com.</li>
        <li>No server side component so pages must be regenerated each time.</li>
        <li>Private files may be uploaded but they will need to be encrypted (e.g. using Ansible Vault)</li>
        <li>This means API keys etc will need to be stored in Ansible Vault before being consumed by Ansible, they cannot be made public due to abuse potential.</li>
        <li>No mysql or other database, so data will need to be stored in sqlite or equivalent, or json file to be queried client side.</li>
        <li>As the build is automatic, the commit message has been set to the build id.</li>
      </ol>

        Rules of creating a Banter space
      </h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://bantervr.com/">Banter</a> is a Unity-based Social VR platform that users can create worlds built with Unity Assets and <a href="https://aframe.io/">A-Frame</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To build a space and host it on your github page, the assets of the scene need to be added to the repository and A-Frame needs to be added to the HTML page.
      </p>
      <p>
        The page when loaded into Banter will load as a space.
