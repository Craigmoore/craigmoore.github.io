    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <h2>Build: ffdc06e9-7955-593e-b790-f70845a1c07d</h2>
    <h2>Rules of building on github pages :</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Create an entirely public repository on github.com.</li>
      <li>No server side component so pages must be regenerated each time.</li>
      <li>Private files may be uploaded but they will need to be encrypted (e.g. using Ansible Vault)</li>
      <li>This means API keys etc will need to be stored in Ansible Vault before being consumed by Ansible, they cannot be made public due to abuse potential.</li>
      <li>No mysql or other database, so data will need to be stored in sqlite or equivalent, or json file to be queried client side.</li>
      <li>As the build is automatic, the commit message has been set to the build id.</li>
    </ol>
